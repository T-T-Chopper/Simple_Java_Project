QUESTION 1 - Write the code that takes the credit and grade information of three courses from the user (one of the characters A, B, C, D in capital letters) and prints the weighted grade average of these three courses on the screen.
Assumptions: Assume that the user always enters data correctly. Credit information will always be given as an integer. In the grade information, A value 4, B value 3, C value 2, D value 1 will be accepted. You can obtain them using their numerical equivalents in the ASCII table.


QUESTION 2 - Write the code that takes two integers from the user and prints the division of the first number by the second number and the remainder of this part to the screen. Write this code first using the "%" operator and then without using this operator.
Assumptions: You can assume that the user will not enter 0 as the second number (divisor) and that the numbers will be natural numbers.


QUESTION 3 - We want to convert the length in centimeters to American units and print it on the screen (feet and inches). Length definitions are given as follows:
1 foot = 30.48 cm
1 inch = 2.54 cm
1 foot = 12 inches
Accordingly, write the code that takes a centimeter length information from the user as an integer and prints it on the screen in feet and inches. Feet and inch representations are made in the form of single quotes and double quotes, respectively, in the American measurement system.
Example:
Feet and inch calculation for 195 cm:
195/30.48 => division 6, remaining 12.12
12.12 / 2.54 = 4.7716â€¦
In this case, the display would look like this:
6' 5''
In the inch notation, round to the nearest whole number. We haven't seen the rounding method yet, but if you add 0.5 to the number you find here and convert it to an int type, you will have the desired rounding.
